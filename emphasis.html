     <h1>What are Focal Points and Emphasis?</h1>
       <h2>White Space is Not Your Enemy definition</h2>
       <p>"A focal point is sometimes called the principle of emphasis, the focal point is the visual center of attention in the design or layout because it focuses the eye's attention."(pg 274) </p><p>"Rule No. 1 about focal points: Have one. Without a focal point, the viewer doesn't know where to look first. If you're trying to capture viewers' attention and control the way their eyes move across the layout, then you need a focal point or CVI."(pg 54)</p>  <p>"Usually the focal point is a visual of some kind. But not all visuals make good focal points. Look for focal-point-worthy visuals such as photographs with strong composition, line, shape, color or interesting angle."(pg 71)</p> <p>"Type treatments also may serve as focal points. The key to typography focal points is contrast by some element of design: space, line, shape, texture, value or color."(pg 72)</p><p>"Once you select a focal point, you have to decide where to put it. The works-every-time layout hangs the focal point from the top of the layout. But knowing a little design theory gives you other options."(pg 72)</p><p><cite>White Space is Not Your Enemy</cite> by Rebecca Hagen and Kim Golombisky.

        <h2>Personal Definition</h2>
     <p>A focal point is the center of a design. The focal point should grab the attention of the viewer, and be the main focus of the design. This should be the first thing your viewer notices and makes them want to continue looking.</p><p>There are different types of focal points. Sometimes an image is the right way to grab a viewers attention, while other times typography is better.</p> <p>When choosing a focal point you have to look at all the elements of the image or type. It is important to pay attention to the shape, contrast, composition and color.</p>
