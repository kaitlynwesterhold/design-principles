     <h1>What is Proximity?</h1>
        <p>"We perceive objects that are close together as belonging to the same group. A related law, the law of Common Fate says that we perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group. Placing elements in proximity to one another goes back to clumping. The idea is to avoid a busy, cluttered layout by physically grouping items together that belong together."(pg 60)</p>

        <h2>Personal Definition</h2>
     <p>Proximity creates a relationship between the elements of the design. By grouping similar elements and styles closely together a sense of proximity is created. Proximity can be split into different groups of objects as well as being only one similar group of objects. If objects are grouped together in proximity the eye of the reader will assume similarity throughout the group. Proximity can add a sense of space or relationship to the design.</p>

        <figcaption>In the image you can tell the proximity of the bricks because the farther away they get the more blurry they get. The angle of the bricks gets smaller the farther away they are.
