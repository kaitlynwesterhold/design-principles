     <h1>What is Balance?</h1>
        <p>"Imagine a seesaw, basically a board pivoting up and down on a fulcrum. When the board is level, the seesaw is balanced. To achieve balance, each side of the board must carry equal weight."(pg 56) </p>  <p>"In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless you communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kids of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical."(pg 56)</p><p>"Radial balance refers to circular designs in which the fulcrum lies at the center, such as dream catchers in Ojibwa Nation culture. Circular designs, often associate with spiritual meanings, are universal across cultures. Interestingly, wherever you split radial balance, you end up with two symmetrical halves. Only radial designs have that property."(pg 57)</p><p>"Whatever the shape, to achieve symmetrical balance, each side of a bisected design must be a mirror image of the other in terms of visual weight."(pg 57)</p><p>"Asymmetry, then, reveals two unequal sides if bisected. Asymmetrical balance tends to be more visually exciting, or at least more visually interesting, than symmetrical balance."(pg 57)</p><p><cite>White Space is Not Your Enemy</cite> by Rebecca Hagen and Kim Golombisky.

        <h2>Personal Definition</h2>
     <p>There are three types of balance. Each type adds a different element to a design in a completely different way. The three types are radial, symmetrical, and asymmetrical.</p>
       <ul>
           <p>
       <li>Radial: a radial balance refers to a design that has a circular balance. Each side of the circular design is symmetrical.</li></p>
      <p> <li>Symmetrical: a symmetrical balance is a design that if split in half each side would be identical. Symmetrical balance is also known as a formal balance and sometimes can be boring.</li></p>
       <p> <li>Asymmetrical: an asymmetrical balance is not the same on each side. Asymmetrical balances are usually more appealing to viewers.</li></p>
       </ul>
