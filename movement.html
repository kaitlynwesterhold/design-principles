     <h1>What is Movement?</h1>
     <p>"The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eyes flow through the composition. The flow of lines can move the eye across the page or screen."(pg 57)</p>
     <p>"Lines, then, can create movement, and different kinds of linear movement tend to communicate different kinds of symbolic messages. Horizontal lines communicate movement flowing left to right or right to left. Vertical lines tend to communicate stability, such as trees and tall buildings. Vertical lines also may communicate inspirational upward movement, such as mountain peaks or downward movement, such as a waterfall. Diagonal lines communicate exciting dynamic movement. Two converging diagonal lines communicate distance, such as a road disappearing into a vanishing point in the distance."(pg 58)</p>

        <h2>Personal Definition</h2>
     <p>There are several different types of movement in a design. Different types of lines are used to show different types of movement. Movement does not always represent an object in motion in design it can also be used to represent the movement of the viewers eyes.</p>
       <ul>
           <p>
       <li>Vertical Lines: vertical lines are usually used to show upward or downward movement. Sometimes vertical lines represent non-moving tall objects.</li></p>
      <p> <li>Horizontal Lines: horizontal lines show side to side movement or motion.</li></p>
       <p> <li>Diagonal Lines: diagonal lines are used to show movement in different ways. Diagonal lines make movement more interesting.</li></p>
    <figure>
     <img src="movement.JPG" class="responsive" alt="tall building"/>
     <figcaption>The image shows two diagonal lines coming towards each other to show movement. The lines allow the movement of the readers eyes to follow the building upwards.
